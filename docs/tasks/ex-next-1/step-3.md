1. Update App header to match page.tsx max width.
2. Dashboard content is too close to the header. Fix it
3. Add /notes/:id page. Should be able to view and edit notes.
4. Update dashboard note list to include a delete button. On delete, remove note from database and update UI, warning user of deletion. Confirm deletion before proceeding.
